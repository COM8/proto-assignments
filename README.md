# protocol-assignment-1

### ToDo:
* Send file metadata e.g. rights, owner, creation date, ...

### Important:
* UDP MTU
* Don't create packages with a size of (bit-size mod 8) != 0. It makes it hard on the receiver side to interpret those!

![FileServerClient state chart](./FileServerClientStateChart.svg)

## Process example:

```
      Client				  Server
	|	Client-Hello-Handshake	    |
	| --------------------------------> | The clients starts the connection on the default port
	|				    | and tells the server the port on which he listens for answers
	|	Server-Hello-Handshake      |
	| <-------------------------------- | The server responds with a client ID and a port where the
	|				    | server is listening for incoming transfer messages
	|	File-Creation		    |
	| --------------------------------> | The client sends this message to inform the server about
	|				    | the new file that will be transferred
	|	Server-ACK  		    |
	| <-------------------------------- |
	|				    |
	|	File-Transfer		    |
	| --------------------------------> | The client starts sending the file
	|				    |
	|	File-Transfer		    |
	| --------------------------------> |
	|				    |
	|	File-Transfer		    |
	| --------------------------------> |
	|				    |
	|	File-Transfer		    |
	| --------------------------------> |
	|				    |
	|	Server-ACK  		    |
	| <-------------------------------- | The server sends an ACK message for each message
	|				    | it received from the client
	|	Server-ACK  		    |
	| <-------------------------------- |
	|				    |
	|	Server-ACK  		    |
	| <-------------------------------- |
	|				    |
	|	Transfer-Ended		    |
	| --------------------------------> | The client tells the server that the transfer finished
```

## Key Exhange

```
      Client				  Server
	|	ClientStartConnection	    |
	| --------------------------------> | Client calculates and sends P,G, it's public key
	|				    | 
	|	onServerReceive             |
	| <-------------------------------- | Server calculates it's shared key,public key and sends it's public key to client
	|				    | sets secureConnection to true
	|	onClientReceive		    |
	| --------------------------------> | Client calculates it's shared key
	|                                   | sets secure connection to true


```
Diffie-Hellman algorithm relies on *discrete logarithm problem.* It is very hard for computers to solve discrete logarithm thus it is a good candidate against brute force attacks. This implementation works like this: 
- Client and server have to have the common values `P` and `G`. P is a prime number and G is the primitive root of that number. As connections are initiated by client, both P and G is calculated by client. Before sending P and G, client generates a private key and calculates it's public key. `P , G and client's public key` are sent to server by the client at the beginning of the connection.

- Server receives P , G , and client's public key. It selects a private key for itself and calculates it own public key. At this calculation, server also successfully calculates the `shared key` that the encryption will be based on. 

- Client receives server's public key and calculates the `shared key`. At this point both server and the client have the same shared key which has never transmitted through insecure channels. 

- Exposed API of Encrypt and Decrypt uses that shared key to encrypt and decrypt messages.

##File syncronisation
In order to do file sync we check periodically if there were files changed (It's planned to switch to Filsystem watcher to monitor for changes). To detect which files were changed we compare the [MD5's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5) of the files to internally saved hashes of them on the last run. 
<br/>_If the files weren't there in the prior_ run, they get marked for complete transmission.
<br/>_If the hash changed_, chunk the data into 900 Byte blocks. For each block we will calculate the [CRC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm). Afterward's it all CRC32 will get compared to the corresponding CRC32 of the previous run. If a CRC32 changed, it replaces the old CRC32 and the Part get's marked for transmission.
<br/>_If nothing changed_, nothing will be send.
